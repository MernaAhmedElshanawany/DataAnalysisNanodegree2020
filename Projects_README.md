# DataAnalysisNanodegree2020:

## Project1: Explore Weather Trends:

* Introduction to the dataset: A dataset that is concerned with the global temperatures and cities average temperatures over time (years). 

* The Goal: The goal is to identify general trends concerning the global temperatures over time weather increasing or decreasing temperatures or no effect through time. 
            It also to identify any interesting trends in my city's temperature (Alexandria) over time. 

* Tools used: SQL : To withdraw data from the data set. 

    Microsoft Excel : To draw the charts needed to identify trends and perform the needed statistics (moving ranges) to work with the data.
            
## Project2: No-show appointements(Kaggle competition):

* Introduction to the dataset: This dataset is concerned with the No-show appointments in a clinic in Brazil. Its size is 100K entries. It was provided by Kaggle.

* The Goal: The goal is to identify interesting trends in the phenomenon of No-shows in the clinic and find answers for our questions of interest. 

* Tools used: Python : To display our dataset and perform data analysis techniques through different functions and commands. 
                       It was also used to draw visuals to identify interesting trends in the dataset. 
              Jupyter Notebook : To display all the work done using python on the data set and display the visuals in order to find the needed conclusions.

## Project3: Hypothesis A/B testing:

* Introduction to the dataset: This dataset is concerned with an old version of a certain site and a newly designed version. 
It is the results of a trial made on some customers who recieved the new design and if they preferred it to the old design or not.

* The Goal: The goal here is to test whether the customers prefer the new version of our site to the old one or not. It is a hypothesis A/B testing project.

* Tools used: Python : To display our dataset and perform data analysis techniques through different functions and commands. 
                       It was also used to draw visuals to identify statistical trends in the dataset like the p-value. 
              Jupyter Notebook : To display all the work done using python on the data set and display the visuals in order to find the needed conclusions.

* Approaches used: Regression : Used through the hypothesis testing process to identify the correlation between certain factors and others. 
                   Probability : To test whether the null hypothesis is true or we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

## Project4: WeRateDogs Twitter account Data Wrangling:

* Introduction to the dataset: This dataset is concerned with the WeRateDogs account in Twitter. 
                               It is an account where dog owners post photos of their dogs and some information about them including names, ratings and others.

* The Goal: The goal is to wrangle this data set in order to be clean and ready for analysis and drawing conclusions. 
            The main focus here is to perform detailed data wrangling techniques.

* Tools used: Python : To display our dataset and perform data wrangling techniques through different functions and commands. 
                       It was also used to draw visuals to identify interesting trends and conclusions in the dataset. 
              Jupyter Notebook : To display all the work done using python on the data set and display the visuals in order to find the needed conclusions. 
              Microsoft Excel : Used to identify certain quality issues with the data set that needs cleaning. 

## Project5: PISA 2012 survey:

* Introduction to the dataset: This dataset is concerned with the PISA evaluation in 2012. 
                               PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. 
                               Around 510K students took part in the assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. 
                               Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.

* The Goal: The goal here is to identify trends and correlations between different factors that impact the students performance and skills as per the PISA evaluation.

* Tools used: Python : To display our dataset and perform data analysis techniques through different functions and commands. 
                       It was also used to draw visuals to identify interesting trends and relations in the dataset. 
              Jupyter Notebook : To display all the work done using python on the data set and display the visuals in order to find the needed conclusions. 
              Microsoft excel : To go through the data set and identify some needed information that couldn't be displayed through the jupyter notebook.
